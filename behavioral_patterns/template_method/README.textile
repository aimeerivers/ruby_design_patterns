h2. Template Method

bq. Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redifine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

I recently saw Jim Weirich show how the calculation of a square root could be refactored and generalised into an algorithm that can calculate any number by approximation and improving the estimate.

The algorithm is basically this: guess a number. Improve the guess until it's good enough, and then return the guess.

I thought this might be suitable for the template method. I have created an @ApproximationCalculator@ class which defines the general algorithm and provides a few methods that can be overridden when desired: @initial_guess@, @close_enough?@, @refine_guess@ and @final_answer@.

The @SquareRootCalculator@ overrides three of the methods in order to define particular parts of the equation.
